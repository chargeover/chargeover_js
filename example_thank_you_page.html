EXAMPLE "THANK YOU" PAGE THAT REDIRECTS TO DIFFERENT URLS, DEPENDING ON PRODUCT

ChargeOver currently only supports redirecting to a single "thank you" page
URL after signing up for a product using hosted sign-up pages.

HOWEVER, you can very easily make that single thank-you page be a redirect that
redirects per product, or per customer, or based on other custom attributes.
This example shows how to redirect to different URLs depending on which product
was purchased.
